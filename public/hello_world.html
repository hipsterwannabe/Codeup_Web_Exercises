		<h1>Hello from Codeup!</h1>
		<p>Hi there! My name is Greg Vallejo, and I'm a student in the <em>"Badlands"</em> cohort of Codeup! It's a <strong>REALLY</strong> challenging 12 week bootcamp on web programming! <br>
		<h2>My Favorite Quote:</h2>
		<blockquote>“When nothing seems to help, I go look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before.”</blockquote>
